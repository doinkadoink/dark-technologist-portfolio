## 🚀 Application Logic Development — Evidence (30%)
- **Implements resubmitted concept**: see "Implementation Notes" mapping brief → sections.
- **Code traceability**: external annotations at docs/code-annotations.md link behaviours to the design brief by file and line range (no source edits).
- **README is useful**: this section provides all marker links.
- **Interactions & states**: described under "Interactions" (pure documentation).
- **Plugins/components**: inventory in docs/plugins-and-deps.md.
- **Data storage**: Not applicable for a static portfolio. Future Option documented below if strictly required by marking.

## 🎮 Interactions
Enumerate interactive elements, expected states, and non-JS fallbacks.

### Navigation Interactions
- **Smooth Scrolling**: JavaScript-enhanced smooth scrolling for navigation links
- **Responsive Menu**: Mobile hamburger menu with touch support
- **Focus Management**: Proper keyboard navigation and focus indicators

### Form Interactions
- **Contact Form**: Form validation and submission handling
- **Input Feedback**: Real-time validation and error messaging
- **Success States**: Clear feedback for successful submissions

### Visual Interactions

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper semantic structure for accessibility

## 🔤 Typography
List primary and fallback fonts. If embedded, link to the CSS rule location (documentation-only).

### Primary Fonts
- **Headings**: Orbitron (Google Fonts) - Futuristic monospace font for titles
- **Body Text**: Rajdhani (Google Fonts) - Clean sans-serif for readability

### Font Stack
```css
/* Documented in styles.css lines 51-150 */
font-family: 'Orbitron', monospace; /* Headings */
font-family: 'Rajdhani', sans-serif; /* Body text */
```

### Fallback Strategy
- **Primary**: Google Fonts with display=swap
- **Fallback**: System fonts (monospace, sans-serif)
- **Loading**: Optimized font loading with font-display: swap

## 🔮 Future Option: storage (no current change)
If assessor mandates storage usage, a follow-up PR can add a non-invasive preference store (theme or reduced-motion) with input limits and no innerHTML sinks. This README section exists purely as a plan; the current branch performs no source edits.

### Potential Implementation
- **Theme Storage**: localStorage for user theme preferences
- **Accessibility Settings**: Store user accessibility preferences
- **Form Data**: Temporary form data persistence
- **Security Considerations**: Input sanitization and validation
