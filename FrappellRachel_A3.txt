Recommendations and review for proposed Website based on competitor Website analysis:

Michael Sherry's website does exhibit visual and structural traits reminiscent of early 2000s design. This includes heavy gradient 
backgrounds, centred block text, and minimal spacing finesse.
? Proposal: Use Michael's site as a cautionary benchmark. emphasize modern layout systems (flex/grid), reduce visual clutter, and 
prioritise responsive interactivity and accessibility.

Emma Troy's website is clearly designed with a strong focus on aesthetics, personality, and visual branding. However, this emphasis 
on elegance introduces some usability trade-offs, particularly in legibility and contrast.
? Proposal: Draw inspiration from her visual cohesion and brand voice, but pair elegant fonts with functional legibility. Maintain 
sufficient contrast and avoid overly decorative typefaces for body content.

Ryan Chilton's website achieves a clean and corporate layout with strong contrast and call-to-action visibility. However, some 
layout elements feel rigid, and long content blocks lack visual relief. Branding is solid, but interactivity is minimal.
? Proposal: Adopt Ryan's clear hierarchy and CTA focus, but enhance user engagement through interactive UI elements, modular 
spacing, and greater visual dynamism.

COMMENT
SCORE
Index.html
Colour
Strong use of navy, light blue (cyan) and white provides 
professional and consistent appearance for branding.
5
Index.html
Font Choice
Accent font is cursive but still legible, distinguishes brand. Non 
serif fonts are large and blocky and provide good legibility.
5
Index.html
Contrast
Generally strong, but some text (especially in the footer and 
dense sections) could use improved contrast or spacing for 
accessibility.
3
Index.html
Repetition/unity
Buttons, fonts, and headings are reused consistently, but 
overuse of repeated styles
4
Index.html
Alignment
Header and footer are aligned well, but content blocks lack 
modularity and spacing. Visual flow is interrupted by text-
heavy layout.
3
Index.html
Proximity
It looks cluttered with text and graphics, text sections look 
more like book paragraphs

Input Interface
No transitional flow animations when scrolling down, buttons 
have basic hover and click interactive features

COMMENT
SCORE
Index.html
 
Colour
Strong reliance on navy and desaturated blue gradients. While 
coherent, the palette feels dated and reminiscent of early 
2000s design styles.
4
Index.html
Font Choice
Uses standard sans-serif fonts. Functional, but lacks character 
or modern typography trends (e.g., varied weights, font 
pairings).
3
Index.html
contrast
Sufficient contrast for legibility, but the dark overlay on 
images flattens depth and makes elements feel compressed 
rather than layered.
3
Index.html
Repetition/unity
Visual consistency is maintained (fonts, colours), but 
repetition is minimal.
4
Index.html
Alignment
Mostly centred alignment throughout. Lacks responsive grid 
structure; content feels blocky. No clear visual hierarchy 
beyond headings.
2
Index.html
Proximity
Moderate spacing between text elements, but buttons and 
CTAs feel crowded together. Could benefit from increased 
white space to guide attention.
2
Index.html
Input Interface
Standard form elements with a basic layout. Functional but 
unengaging. Form lacks animation or progressive interaction 
feedback.
2
Index.html
Output Interface

The site claims to be responsive, but interaction is minimal. A 
persistent reCAPTCHA badge follows the user across the page. 
Though not a popup, it behaves like one and distracts from 
content visibility.

Colour
Uses soft neutrals, beige, and blush tones to evoke calm and 
elegance. Emotionally effective for branding, but low contrast 
with white backgrounds may reduce clarity.
4
Index.html
Font Choice
Stylish serif and cursive fonts convey personality, but the thin 
cursive text (e.g., "Choose your adventure") can be difficult to 
read, especially on smaller screens.
3
Index.html
contrast
Aesthetic choices reduce visual contrast. Light greys and thin 
script fonts against white backgrounds impair legibility for 
some users.
3
Index.html
Repetition/unity
Strong brand cohesion. Fonts, iconography, and colour usage 
are repeated consistently. Layout patterns feel elegant and 
intentional.
5
Index.html
Alignment
Excellent alignment and spacing. Clear use of margins and 
visual hierarchy enhances flow and maintains user attention.
5
Index.html
Proximity
Clear grouping of elements and whitespace management gives 
a refined, editorial feel. Captions, images, and CTAs are 
spatially coherent. Always leaves content cut off at the bottom 
to encourage further scrolling.
5
Index.html
Input Interface

Contact buttons and links are minimal but functional. 
However, form interactions are stylistic and not heavily 
animated.
4
Index.html
Output Interface
Responsive across devices. However, menu is extremely 
confusing and punishes user with a loading screen despite all 
content being on the same page.
