4.0 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS 

SUMMARY - COMPETITIVE REVIEW of THREE APPLICATIONS
	URL	Description
1	https://ryanchilton.com.au/local/web-design-gold-coast/ 
Ryan Chilton’s web design portfolio made for self-promotion of web building services
2	https://www.michaelsherry.com.au/web-design-gold-coast/ 
Michael Sherry’s web design portfolio made for self-promotion of web building services
3	https://emmatroy.com.au/ 
Emma Troy’s web design portfolio made for self-promotion of web building services
Recommendations and review for proposed Website based on competitor Website analysis:

Michael Sherry’s website does exhibit visual and structural traits reminiscent of early 2000s design. This includes heavy gradient backgrounds, centred block text, and minimal spacing finesse.
→ Proposal: Use Michael’s site as a cautionary benchmark. emphasize modern layout systems (flex/grid), reduce visual clutter, and prioritise responsive interactivity and accessibility.

Emma Troy’s website is clearly designed with a strong focus on aesthetics, personality, and visual branding. However, this emphasis on elegance introduces some usability trade-offs, particularly in legibility and contrast.
→ Proposal: Draw inspiration from her visual cohesion and brand voice, but pair elegant fonts with functional legibility. Maintain sufficient contrast and avoid overly decorative typefaces for body content.

Ryan Chilton’s website achieves a clean and corporate layout with strong contrast and call-to-action visibility. However, some layout elements feel rigid, and long content blocks lack visual relief. Branding is solid, but interactivity is minimal.
→ Proposal: Adopt Ryan’s clear hierarchy and CTA focus, but enhance user engagement through interactive UI elements, modular spacing, and greater visual dynamism.

APPLICATION NAME: Ryan Chilton Portfolio
PAGE	ITEM	COMMENT	SCORE
Index.html	Colour	Strong use of navy, light blue (cyan) and white provides professional and consistent appearance for branding.	5
Index.html	Font Choice	Accent font is cursive but still legible, distinguishes brand. Non serif fonts are large and blocky and provide good legibility.	5
Index.html	Contrast	Generally strong, but some text (especially in the footer and dense sections) could use improved contrast or spacing for accessibility.	3
Index.html	Repetition/unity	Buttons, fonts, and headings are reused consistently, but overuse of repeated styles	4
Index.html	Alignment	Header and footer are aligned well, but content blocks lack modularity and spacing. Visual flow is interrupted by text-heavy layout.	3
Index.html	Proximity	It looks cluttered with text and graphics, text sections look more like book paragraphs	3
Index.html	Input Interface	No transitional flow animations when scrolling down, buttons have basic hover and click interactive features	3
https://ryanchilton.com.au/	Output Interface	Client list animations appear glitchy when hovering. Responsive design is evident when switching to mobile. 	3

APPLICATION URL: https://www.michaelsherry.com.au/web-design-gold-coast/ 
APPLICATION NAME: Michael Sherry
PAGE	ITEM	COMMENT	SCORE
Index.html
 	Colour	Strong reliance on navy and desaturated blue gradients. While coherent, the palette feels dated and reminiscent of early 2000s design styles.	4
Index.html	Font Choice	Uses standard sans-serif fonts. Functional, but lacks character or modern typography trends (e.g., varied weights, font pairings).	3
Index.html	contrast	Sufficient contrast for legibility, but the dark overlay on images flattens depth and makes elements feel compressed rather than layered.	3
Index.html	Repetition/unity	Visual consistency is maintained (fonts, colours), but repetition is minimal.	4
Index.html	Alignment	Mostly centred alignment throughout. Lacks responsive grid structure; content feels blocky. No clear visual hierarchy beyond headings.	2
Index.html	Proximity	Moderate spacing between text elements, but buttons and CTAs feel crowded together. Could benefit from increased white space to guide attention.	2
Index.html	Input Interface	Standard form elements with a basic layout. Functional but unengaging. Form lacks animation or progressive interaction feedback.	2
Index.html	Output Interface	
The site claims to be responsive, but interaction is minimal. A persistent reCAPTCHA badge follows the user across the page. Though not a popup, it behaves like one and distracts from content visibility.

APPLICATION URL: https://emmatroy.com.au/ 
APPLICATION NAME: Emma Troy
PAGE	ITEM	COMMENT	SCORE
Index.html
 	Colour	Uses soft neutrals, beige, and blush tones to evoke calm and elegance. Emotionally effective for branding, but low contrast with white backgrounds may reduce clarity.	4
Index.html	Font Choice	Stylish serif and cursive fonts convey personality, but the thin cursive text (e.g., “Choose your adventure”) can be difficult to read, especially on smaller screens.	3
Index.html	contrast	Aesthetic choices reduce visual contrast. Light greys and thin script fonts against white backgrounds impair legibility for some users.	3
Index.html	Repetition/unity	Strong brand cohesion. Fonts, iconography, and colour usage are repeated consistently. Layout patterns feel elegant and intentional.	5
Index.html	Alignment	Excellent alignment and spacing. Clear use of margins and visual hierarchy enhances flow and maintains user attention.	5
Index.html	Proximity	Clear grouping of elements and whitespace management gives a refined, editorial feel. Captions, images, and CTAs are spatially coherent. Always leaves content cut off at the bottom to encourage further scrolling.	5
Index.html	Input Interface	
Contact buttons and links are minimal but functional. However, form interactions are stylistic and not heavily animated.	4
Index.html	Output Interface	Responsive across devices. However, menu is extremely confusing and punishes user with a loading screen despite all content being on the same page.	3
		Application total Score	32
